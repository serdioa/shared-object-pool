        Yet another subtle and intuitive property comes from the naive understanding
        of how programs work. Under Java Memory Model, in absence of synchronization,
        the order of independent reads is undefined. That includes reads of the *same*
        variable!

        also ordered). Java "volatile" assumes this property.

        Conclusion: coherency is something that is assumed intuitively. However, under the
        data race (= in the absence of synchronization) the absence of coherence for plain
        accesses may lead to surprising results.

        Are reads/writes coherent?

          plain:                           no
          volatile:                       YES
          VH (plain):                      no
          VH (opaque):                    YES
          VH (acq/rel):                   YES
          VH (volatile):                  YES

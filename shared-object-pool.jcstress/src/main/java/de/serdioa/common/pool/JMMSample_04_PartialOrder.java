        The next property comes in relation to inter-thread semantics. In JMM,
        happens-before mandates what results are plausible and what are not, when
        non-synchronized reads are involved. That order is partial, so there are
        pairs of reads/writes we can tell nothing about order-wise.

        For example, in the case of two non-volatile variables, JMM allows observing
        "1, 0"!

        The easiest way to solve this is to turn $v into volatile variable. In JMM,
        that would mean that the only execution which can justify (1, 0) is invalid:
        it has broken happens-before consistency. E.g. in the execution

          write(x, 1) --hb--> write(y, 1) --hb--> read(y):1 --hb--> read(x):1

        ...read(x) should have seen "1", not "0".

        Conclusion: the minimal inter-thread semantics (happens-before) is guaranteed for acquire/releases and
        volatiles. Anything weaker does not guarantee this effect

        Do inter-thread reads/writes form partial order?

          plain:                           no
          volatile:                       yes
          VH (plain):                      no
          VH (opaque):                     no
          VH (acq/rel):                   yes
          VH (volatile):                  yes
